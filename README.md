## Todo API with Django REST Framework
Welcome to the repository for my Todo API project, an API built using Django REST Framework.

### Features
- **Secure User Authentication:** Implements token-based authentication to ensure that endpoints are secured and actions are performed only by authenticated users.
- **Personalized User Interaction:** Each user interacts only with their Todos. The API filters responses based on the authenticated user's identity, ensuring personalized user experiences.
- **CRUD Functionality:** Supports complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items, enabling users to manage tasks effectively.

### API Documentation
